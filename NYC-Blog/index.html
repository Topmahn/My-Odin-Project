            New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens,
            Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the
            home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the
            City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is
            currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists.
            However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasnâ€™t unveiled
            until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times
            Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and
            bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York
            Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was
            named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges
            that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.

            While the view in the city is beautiful, the sounds are not as
            lovely. Below you'll see an example of the view and the sounds
            you'll deal with in NYC on a daily basis.
